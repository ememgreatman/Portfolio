This is my Portfolio as a Quality Assurance Engineer

# About Me

Hi, my name is Emem Greatman. Since the beginning of 2021 I have been studying and practicing QA. I am happy to have finally found an area in which I can successfully develop myself. The subject of accessibility is particularly important to me. In the QA position I see the potential to make, at the very least, the digital world more welcoming for every person. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase my practical skills that I have gained through courses, self-study and my job. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. I have also started learning test automation in, so at the moment my main focus is on furthering my knowledge (and practice!) in this area.

I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as an industrial chemist. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems. I got my Bachelor's Degree from the University of Uyo, AkwaIbom.

Now, I wish to exploit my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.
I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal â€” to become a senior software tester in 2 years.

 # My Experience

Being a Quality assurance software tester at Aella Financial Solutions is my third professional position strictly in QA area. I have made a significant growth both in my tech and soft skills, such as strong analytical thinking and developped some know-how in test automation. In addition, in my previous job, one of my responsibilities was to oversee the correct operation of the internal system and report any bugs or defects to the administrators. I have grown very fond of this role, which has also made me interested in the QA path.
